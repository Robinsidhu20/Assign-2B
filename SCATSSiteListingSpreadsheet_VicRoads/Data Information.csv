"Raw, un-validated data by its very nature is unpredictable. No effort will be made to repair, filter or manipulate the data. Traffic light data from time to time will be unavailable due to road works, routine maintenance and or equipment failure. Equipment failure may include data that periodically over counts due to poor lane discipline. On average 10% of data is unusable. ",,,,,,,,
